		description: `I have worked on developing various IT tools in the field of project management and administration:

– Developed a plugin for the open-source software QGIS to automate the extraction of cartographic data. I primarily developed this tool in Python, using libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, etc. Then, I worked on formatting the extracted data to export it in Word format (python-docx library).

– Development of a management tool in Microsoft Excel to centralize the data from quotes generated by the different branches of the company. The code for this tool was written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), a language integrated into Excel.

– Worked with the open-source software WebODM to develop a code allowing users to process and merge images taken with a drone, resulting in an orthophoto.`,
